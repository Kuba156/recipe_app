# recipe_app

My first frontend app done in react (no redux) with a tutorial.
Uses bootstrap.

For the app to work you'd have to add your api_key to the config.js file in the src. Contents would look like:
export const config = { 
  key : "your_api_key"
}

Run npm install to install dependencies
Run npm start to run the server locally
